# Problem
The goal of the project is to predict whether a patient is at risk of developing chronic kidney disease, 
given certain biological information. Furthermore, we are interested in seeing relationships between chronic 
kidney disease and other diseases due to similar variables or factors. Based on the given data, our algorithm will 1. 
Assess their relative risk of disease progression and 2. Recommend combative measures to decrease their risk of disease 
development, if they are at risk. An example would be to have a patient data inputted, then have our code assess 
whether they are at risk, which factors are most likely contributing to disease progression and then propose 
a solution to mitigate disease development. 

# Dataset
UCI ML Repository: (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Chronic_Kidney_Disease)
Dataset containing multiple variables e.g. blood pressure, age, glucose levels 
and whether or not the patient has chronic kidney disease

National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive Kidney Diseases:
(https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database#diabetes.csv)
Dataset collected from women in India. Measures certain variables 
such as age, pregnancies, glucose levels and whether or not they have diabetes 


NYS Patient Characteristics Survey (PCS) - 2015:
(https://www.kaggle.com/new-york-state/nys-patient-characteristics-survey-pcs-2015?fbclid=IwAR2TH9VdNzOyBEZWJdjzZyp69rNbEvk9unsW267QoWLQyfLw6c2yZ6Ky6-U)
Dataset collected from patients in NYS. Listed living habits and diseases (diabetes, kidney diseases etc.), 
age group (adult or child) etc. 



# Proposed Solution and Real world Application
Our solution is to use statistical analyses on existing data to help predict whether or not a patient is at risk of developing chronic kidney disease. We will also be finding which exact variables they have that are the main contributors to the predictive assessment. Applications include early risk detection to plan an early treatment method to reduce their risk of chronic kidney disease development. Furthermore, we will be concatenating this information with datasets collected from other diseases to see any relationships between similar biological factors.
